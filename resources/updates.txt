#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. DB connection changed to close properly (doQuerry): put close on finally at the end of try catch.
2. Fixed error import tables the 1st time when open 'database management' since it requires to left click to identify current level and current database. Now any click would identify those two.
3. Move get_parameter_tooltip from Read_Identifiers to Get_Parameter_Information to avoid read "strata_definition" file each time we need YT column's tooltip
4. Table Filter applied on all tables (when double left click) in main window and database management window 
5. Management overview now support viewing chart summary for multiple existing strata
6. Fixed showing MS abbreviation after adding split constraints
7. Change UI for NoParameter, NoIdentifier, CostParameter
8. fix Read Strata.
9. Add matchDataType for all 9 tables to get rid of the codes defining data type in "Reload after creating GUI"

11. change ageclass "not found" --> null
12. Change code to trigger refreshing info of the model overview table 
13. readUserConstraints: change finding index to search column name to find index
14. Add id column, add FREE type, and add multiplier to user constraints table (the id is unique --> to prepare for flow constraints)
15. Move to the first added constraint after add new
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

16. Auto generate constraint unique id whenever a constraint or set of contraints are added
17. Free constraint is added into model as v(n)
18. multiplier is now activated when running model

20. User Constraints --> Basic Constraints
21. Add icon help for all panels. Move all icons to helpToolBar and put it to the top right of each panel.
22. Add rollover effect for 3 icons in the background window
23. Add Quick Edit for Basic Constraints window, this Quick Edit needs data to be update constantly after each New, New Set, or Delete Constraints.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

26. Show/Hide Logo feature
27. Change Font feature
28. Regain focus on the table when showing 2 Charts, change mouse listener to selection listener for showing the 2nd chart (Ctrl A works)
29. Change minimum size of MAIN in ComponentResizer to 600x35
30. Change the way writing parameters, static identifiers, dynamic identifiers to the basic constraints table (to prepare for constraint reload)
31. Change element_id --> attribute_id (input08 & strata_definition)
32. Change relaxed_perrcentage (Advanced Constraints) to 0-100%
33. Show/hide columns feature (Base Cost): 2 Preset selection choices: show default columns & show active columns. 
34. Disable columns that are not "per acre" to prevent users' mistakes (Base Cost & Parameters in Basic Constraints)
35. Trim all read_Identifiers --> read only once before reload GUI or add new strata_definition
36. Flow constraints are now active in the model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

37. Fix: now SpectrumLite can run without having any flow constraint set up

42. Flow: add new automatically set relaxed_percentage to 100%
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

43. Add more details for the flow grapth description
44. Bug fixed (problem 2): due to a random function to pick EA table.
45. Change horizental resize in input4 and input7
46. Using Double.MIN_VALUE cause problem with flow upperbound_percentage constraint (Concert error incompatible bounds). Double.MAX_VALUE sounds to be unaffected. To make everything safe, 1 change was made for the whole modeling system: 1) Double.MIN_VALUE ---> - Double.MAX_VALUE
47. Set Font is now only available when all internal windows are closed
48. Bug fixed: read the correct annual discount rate (bug: read period instead of rate. This might happen during refactoring input01)
49. Currenly flow logic only support positive multipliers, the use of negative multipliers is prohibited.
50. introduce output06_basic_constraints
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

51. Allow to write solution without requiring any basic constraint set up
52. Multi-threads method is applied whenever start editting --> improve User experience with significant increase in reloading speed.

57. output5 is now having a much more faster Filter method applied
58. Move MS Fire method to above Even Age method
59. Deselect or select static identifiers will only work with visible checkboxes --> to prevent select or de-select invisible periods which slow the Table Filter
60 Users are allowed to set up min and max rotation age for both existing and regeneration strata
61. Allow capture images of GUI components (Ctrl + 1)
62. Clear 17 Bugs identified by FindBugs. The codes is now technically bug-free. The logic Bugs however may exist (Hopefully I am not that unlucky)
63. Database import has a security check to deny database that is not following SpectrumLite's data requirements
64. All existing strata that is not linked to Natural Growth table (-->not found starting ageclass) will not be selectable for modeled_strata. The codes change is located in the update_management_overview (table model overview)
65. Many shortcut keys have been applied
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

66. Remove xEAe in the model logic since it is not necessary to have it. Changes include: remove xEAe in eq.10, eq.12a; remove the entire eq.11a; remove the entire eq.11c. And all variables are renamed.
67. Remove xEAe in the software codes, including:
- Changes and removals of the codes of the equations logic
- Change silviculture method to short names in Read_Indentifiers: Natural Growth --> NGe, Prescribed Burn -->PBe, Group Selection --> GSe, Even Age --> EAe
- Remove the conversion to detailed silviculture method names in ScrollPane_StaticIdentifiers & Panel_EditRun_Details & Output_Panel_Management_Details

69. Fix method to get currentProjectFolder, previously based on active internal frame which is bad.
70. Fix error with multiple project lost icon buttons when edit runs of a project when other projects opened. This is due to JButton btnedit is defined as static and pass to the threads. static is removed.
71. change both logic and GUI: c -->s5R, t (in xEAe, xEAr) --> tR,
72. old formulation 12a is wrong? ex: tR,a,t only add 6,4,3 while we should add 6,4,3 and 6,5,3 (assume tR = 6 and t = 3) -->changed!
73. Print out the long variable value without using 2 digits after the dot (twoDform)
74. Change row ID search to the correct ones for XEAr and XNGr (both in codes and in formulation)
	- For xEAr: row to find = aR - 1 + t - tR
	- For xNGr: row to find = a - 1
75. For logic replacing bug: change eq. (12a): change loop tR from t + 1 (in xEAe and xEAr) to remove the period tR=t which has clear cut from calculating SR's area loss
76. Check all xEAe and xEAr condition from eq.10 to eq.15 (processing_age should be changed to rotation_age to make the codes more intuitive)
	- eq.10, eq.11b, eq.12a, eq.13: change processingAge to rotationAge: keep the calculation (actually no logic has been changed)
77. Solve the auto check "implementation" columns at some default rows, if the input03 exists and is successfully loaded 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

78. Change xEar: a-->aR in eq. 12a, 13
79. Change c-->s5r in eq.12a
80. Change c-->s5r and c'-->s5r' in eq.12b
81. Still keep c and c' in the codes because it is easier to read constraints (may need to change later)
82. Change database "strata" name to match name requirements in Part 2: SpectrumLite database: switch timing_choice and forest_status  
	- Get_Variable_Information & 
	- public void create_sample()
	- public String get_starting_ageclass
83. Hide PBr, GSr in the GUI, show them later after the future update of PBr and GSr in the model formulation

96. Move strata_definition to database
	- Change class name: Read_Indentifiers--> Read_Definition
	- Read_Definition: now read from strata_definition inside the database
	- FilesHandles: public static File chosenDefinition(): change strata_definition.csv to default_database.db and create that file to put into src

108. Boost 2: only define variable that is associated with unempty prescription/yieldtable
	- Formulation:
		- MS: Remove 6b, make it the bound of variables so it would be no-problem if not defined (not affect boost 2)
		- BS: Remove 6d, make it the bound of variables so it would be no-problem if not defined (not affect boost 2)

109. variables x[s1][s2][s3][s4][s5][s6][4] (also x[s1][s2][s3][s4][s5][s6][5]) would have the bounds set to 0 if no prescriptions for MS (also BS) exists. This make output04 pie chart so correctly

All changes in this block are associated with v29.jar, formulation24.docx, database4.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

110. Allow Flow chart (in output_07) resizable on right border
111. Important LinkedList is used to define layer: layer = (layer_id, layer_description, attributes) where attibutes is also a linked list (not use anywhere yet)
112. Change some uneditable columns in some tables (5, 6, 7, 8a) to darker colors; Align regeneration_percentage to the right
113. Bug 6 is fixed: set bounds to 0 for x(s1,s2,s3,s4,s5,s6,q) in eq. 7a, 8a, 9a, 10
114. Add Feature Auto Reload a basic constraint after left click released (This feature is a must for the design of Cost Adjustment GUI)
	- Reload dynamic identifiers (add 1 more column to the table: original_dynamic_identifiers, reload based on this column info)
	- Reload static identifiers
	- Reload Parameters
115. Edit button in Basic Constraints is now functional
116. Important Change: fix defining new list: for example, see ScrollPane_StaticIdentifiers where the 4 lists are defined. Need to change other places as well  --- Check Check later
117. Hide some columns in basic constraints and cost adjustment conditions, since it is always loaded to interface on click release
118. Add an options of submit/cancel for Edit button
119. Reload also work on key board selection by navigating
120. define all_layers all_layersToolTip, layers_Title, layers_Title_ToolTip only once after ReadDatabase
121. Remove Read_Databse (null) in some Panels to get rid of the "null" report - not actually error
122. output05_management_details is allowed to stop the Customize Mode GUI on click
123. Multi-threads are applied to improve Table Filter in output05. Need to review later.
124. Fixed reload based on table 10 (convert view to model) when writting reload for table 8, 9
125. Edit take effect immediately on click
126. age_class and action_type can now be placed any where in the yield tables (previously the col id must be 3 and last id respectively)
127. Change variable index in both GUI and formulation. Example: EAe --> EA_E, NGr --> NG_R, etc.
128. Rewrite the output05 filter: fix layer1 filter (make it false to have the same structure as other layers), and use more return to escape entry checking faster.
129. Change condition check for priting out total_penalty (currenly it does not print out total_penalty when upperbound = 0 which is wrong)
130. empty cell is now used for cost condition override
131. Remove drag on basic_table because it is simply annoying
132. Very important: Highlight layer 5 and 6 in red (Static identifier) since it is applied for existing strata only, regenerated strata do not use those 2 layers.
133. Very important: output05 filter (Static identifier): layer 5 and 6 are applied for existing strata only.
134. Management Cost GUI is built and and Logic is connected

All changes in this block are associated with v30.jar, formulation25.docx, database5.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

135. Some changes to match codes and formulation:
	- Eq 15: change rotation_age = 9999 which is wrong --> the right thing is: rotation_age = aR
	- Define variable: forgot to add underscore to PB_E variable --> fixed
	- Eq 15: change indexes for xEA_E and xEA_R variables to match formulation
	- private static Boolean are_all_static_identifiers_matched: only check identifiers vs layer5 and layer6 if forest_status is E and method is not MS or BS
	- Get_Variable_Information: add a "not available" whenever a search is implemented for each term --> this is a security in case of bad situation 
	- get_final_action_cost_list_and_conversion_cost_list_for_this_variable: add 2 if to make sure all null (or "") condition can be run:
		- if (this_condition_info[2].length() > 0) {
		- if (this_condition_info[3].length() > 0) {
	- reload_this_condition_action_cost_and_conversion_cost: add 2 if to make sure all null (or "") condition can be reloaded:
		- if(action_cost_info.length() > 0) {
		- if(conversion_cost_info.length() > 0) {
136. Popup added for Cost Conditons, Basic Constraints, and Advanced Constraints so users have a chance to not modify if accidently hit the button
137. Allow: age_class (CGNF) or st_age_10 (CNPZ) to be searched as age, and hca_allsx (CNPZ) or rmcuft (CGNF) to show up as default in action cost
138. Change name for the panels in edit_details, add a new panel "Silviculture Method"
139. table_overview: add count strata and acres of the currently highlighted rows
140. Remove agelass from the extra layer permanently (now only method and period are used as 2 extra layers)
141. Redefine static_Identifiers scroll pane so it has more options of which layers to be added, also use it in Model Strata GUI (remove the previous long codes)
142. Refactor (Rename) a lot of tables, data, etc. THIS IS DANGEROUS! but necessary for the new input: silviculture_method
143. GUI completed for Silviculture Method Panel
144. Temporarily switch radioButton_Right (2 places at the start of edit_runs_details) to move Silvicultuer method after Model Strata
145. Boost 5:
	- Read_RunInputs: return unique model_strata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype, model_strata_without_sizeclass (this one is currently not used)
	- Except 12a, 13, 6a to 6e, and the definition of xEA_E: all the other definition and equations have the for loop rewritten
146. Fix the IF THEN that forgot to add for eq 15 regeneration variables

All changes in this block are associated with v31Boost5BufFixed.jar, formulation25.docx, database5.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

147. Some refactor in Panel_SolveRuns, Read_RunInputs, also fix some loops in Read_RunInputs (general_inputs & model_strata: remove the column header row before saving values)
148. Remove IF Then (for stactic_identifiers) in eq.15 by using common_strata & common_trata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype (retailAll method)
149. SpectrumLite --> Prism : all names are replaced
150. Boost 1 completed (NG_E NG_R are default applied to every strata)
151. Hide the checkbox column in Silviculture Method (Could be deleted but still keep it incase if we need to use in the future)

All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.00.jar, Prism Formulation 01.docx, Prism Database 01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

151. Boost 1: alow to interact with NG_E and NG_R in "Silviculture Method" window
152. Bug 9 fixed for equation 7a when an "if then" to remove constraint is unreachable.

All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.01.jar, Prism Formulation 01.docx, Prism Database 01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

153. Add null check for sm_strata & sm_strata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype: This would allow all methods eligible to be applied if users do not have any row set up in "Silviculture Method" window.
154. Highlighted soft and hard constraints with colors
155. Remove currentPeriod in Panel_solveRuns, it is t --> no need to define
156. output05 now has the query works properly. Need more function anyway.

All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.03.jar, Prism Formulation 01.docx, Prism Database 01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

157. QuickEdit_FlyConstraints is created.
158. Change all class and method to private in Output_Panel_Management_Details
159. Fly_Constraints can now be saved and reloaded (This output would be deleted any time you save after "Edit" or "Solve" the run)
160. Panel_yieldProject: in public void refreshProjectTree(): do not allow output_05_fly_constraints to appear in the GUI

All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.04.jar, Prism Formulation 01.docx, Prism Database 01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

161. Boost 6:

	- Remove int[][][][][][][] xPBr
	- Remove int[][][][][][][] xGSr
	- Remove int[][][][][][][][][][] xEAr
Save at 09/08/2017 - Retrieve later if need this boost but probably will never use this bad boost
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

162. Auto save is triggered right after run querries using the "play" button in output05
163. Output 05 querries are put into thread when "play" button is clicked. This is to avoid frozen screen
164. Close all running threads and call gabage collector to retrieve memory after mouse click on Poject Jtree. This is important since It helps get memory back from the thread running querries in output05 (this threads add up memory if not call system.gc()) Note: the call system.gc sometimes does not trigger the collection. Note 2: This thing slows down the system --> disable.
165. Print out more information during the solving process
166. Bug 10 fixed (BS and MS timing choice jumping)
	- 6c is now 6b, t-->1
	- 6e is now 6d, t-->1

173. Bug 12 fixed (Cost constraints & queries fail) --> Add one more method into Get_Parameter_Information
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.09.jar, Prism Formulation 01.docx, Prism Database 01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

174. Disable background colors of constraint type (free, soft, hard), use colorful icons for cells instead.
175. Using join threads when import database (not the first time) to allow moving screen (not frozen) when import
176. Also use join threads in Panel_EditRun with all threads start after the GUI is set up so all the runs are loaded properly.
177. Auto make constraints type to be "FREE" when a basic or a flow is added, or when a split set of basic constraints is added without specifying the type
178. Remove all join threads as described in 175 & 176 (use normal threads instead) because sometimes some runs are missed when many runs are loading using joind threads at the same time.
179. Trim queries & re-define arrays in Read_Database: Read_yield_tables --> significantly cut time reading CGNF from 30 sec to less than 3 sec. This is DR Boost 1.
180. Some minor changes: south textfield info would show nothing if nothing is highlighted, query textfield has the texts auto cleared with mouse enter & exit listeners
181. Redesign the Model Strata window (change icons, quick edit window, etc.), Redesign General Inputs window
182. In Database Management: change database JToolBar to GribBag layout so the queryTextField can stretch the toolbar.This help type and see very long query
183. set default discount rate in General Inputs to zero
184. Change size of Import Database Jchooser window to a preferred size of 800 * 500
185. Allow users to write a readme file
184. Design some convenience classes to trim codes: PrismTitleScrollPane, PrismGridBagLayoutHandle
185. Main window has new function: "Rename" and "Copy"
186. Change ShortCut Key for Database Management to ALT + D since CTRL + D would delete a line in eclipse IDE --> dangerous using CTRL + D
187. If only level 3 nodes in Runs Tree are selected --> keep them all selected, not remove

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

188. Define preferred size for nested scroll inside PrismTitleScrollPane to avoid misbehavior that the nested does not scroll properly and image lost.
189. Define readme as a class, show this readme as textarea in main GUI --> no requirement to limit the line's length
190. Fix Bug with readme by defining this at top of Panel_EditRun_Details: private JTextArea readme = new TextArea_ReadMe();
191. Write reading_time, solving_time, and writing_time in general_outputs
192. RR Boost 1: 
	- add 2 new arrays to store indexes of prescription & row_id
	- Move the search for prescription & row_id outside of Get_Parameter_Information --> private static int[] prescription_and_row (this function needs to be in both Panel_SolveRun & Output_Panel_Management_Details) 
193. Rewrite the search of prescription & row_id for management_details output in Panel_SolveRun
194. RR Boost 2 completed: Remove unnecessary duplicated "yield_tables_names_list.contains" method
195. RR Boost 3a completed: binary search is implemented for "private static int[] get_prescription_and_row"
196. RR Boost 3b completed: Binary search for model_strata (the 6 layers strata)
	- Read_Database: Query for existing_strata is now sorted (Order By strata_id ASC)
	- Panel_SolveRun: Binary search is implemented for model_strata  which returns the sorted strata_id. All system core constraints and user constraints are benefited with the searching of 30 arrays would be O(1).
197. RR Boost 3c completed: Binary search for model_strata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype (the 4 layers strata)
	- Do not need to sort because this strata 4 layers are extracted from strata 6 layers --> should be already sorted when added
	- Panel_SolveRun: Binary search is implemented in many places that have 4 layers strata.
198. RR Boost 3d: Binary search combined with other changes
	- Binary search on the following: eq: 12a, 13
	- Starting_age & strata_area: redimension by merging 6 layers. This would save memory although not significantly, and also save reading time
	- Delete all the following when possible (6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 7a, 7b, 8a, 9a, 9b, 10, 11, 12a, 12b, 13, 14a, 14b, 14c, 14d, 15). This would speed up reading time
		int s1 = layer1.indexOf(strata.substring(0,1));
		int s2 = layer2.indexOf(strata.substring(1,2));
		int s3 = layer3.indexOf(strata.substring(2,3));
		int s4 = layer4.indexOf(strata.substring(3,4));
		int s5 = layer5.indexOf(strata.substring(4,5)); (exception: 7b, 8b, 9b, 10, 11, 12a, 12b, 13, 14a, 14b, 14c, 14d, 15)
		int s6 = layer6.indexOf(strata.substring(5,6)); (exception: 12a, 12b, 13, 14a, 14b, 14c, 14d)
	- Delete all the following when possible (15). This would speed up reading time
		List<String> current_var_static_condition = new ArrayList<String>();
		current_var_static_condition.add(layers_Title.get(0) + layer1.get(s1));	
		current_var_static_condition.add(layers_Title.get(1) + layer2.get(s2));	
		current_var_static_condition.add(layers_Title.get(2) + layer3.get(s3));	
		current_var_static_condition.add(layers_Title.get(3) + layer4.get(s4));	
		current_var_static_condition.add(layers_Title.get(4) + layer5.get(s5));	
199. Also apply RR Boost 3d on Output_Panel_Management_Details for faster queries
200. RR Boost 4: Binary Search --> No Search wherever possible		DISABLE DISABLE DISABLE since it not faster and code is hard to read, saved as RRB4 in prismBackups folder
	- Remove binary search for following variables: x, 
	- Remove binary search for following equations: 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9a, 9b, 10, 11 (6 layers)
	- Remove binary search for following equations: 12a, 12b, 13, 14a, 14b, 14c, 14d  (4 layers)
	- Remove binary search for management_overview in Panel_SolveRun

201. Use Lamdar Code for all button's actionlisteners whenever possible to simplify codes: applied on Panl_EditRun_Details, Panel_SolveRun, Panel_DatabaseManagement, Panel_Project
202. 30 larger arrays and 5 large lists are set to null when not being used any more (to help Garbage Collector)
203. Print out more information during solving process (time for reading each basic constraint)
204. RR Boost 5: Improve speed of reading cost constraints, including:
	- Move Cost Check outside of Get_parameter_Information --> private class Cost_Calculation
	- Define 10 more arrays to store cost_value for each variables, cost_value is read wheneded and will be stored in array to never read again --> speed up later cost constraints
	- Rewrite eq (15) using the new class, also move check condition of defined variables to only calculate when necessary --> speed up
	- Set the new 10 arrays to "null" when not use any more
205. Memory Boost 9:
	- Delete 30 arrays storing prescription, row_id, cost_value
	- Define 3 new arrays to store prescription, row_id, cost_value: int[] var_prescription, int[] var_row_id, double[] var_cost_value 
	- Rewrite all the variables define (remove all 30 old arrays) & eq 15 (using the new 3 arrays) 
	- Set the new 3 arrays to "null" when not use any more
206. Move Cost_Calculation out to be a public class so it can be used for querying output_05_management_details --> Rename to Get_Cost_Information
207. Query for output_05 is rewritten to use the class "Get_Cost_Information".

219. Runs that is not successfully loaded when EDIT will be disable
220. Allow priority spinner keep moving items when the arrow is still on hold. Also disable the textfield from editing. Also scroll to the new position 
221. Spinner to move rows is added for: Silviculture Method, Basic Constraints, Flow Constraints, and output05_Management_Details
222. Use another method to hide column (not set size to 0) so copy to excel do not copy the hidden columns. Implemented on:
	- output_05 table
	- Silviculture Method table
	- Management Cost condition table
	- Basic Constraints table
	- Flow Constraints - Sources table

227. Quick Edit for Management Cost window is redesigned to be in a reasonable position
228. Management Cost window: Whenever a row is selected --> The "Action Cost" table would show active columns instead of showing default columns.
229. All components in Management Cost are re-positioned
230. Changing values in the tables in Management Cost window would take effect immediately
231. Moving hightlight color into each ScrollPane. Also change to highlight the whole area instead of the border only (when Modify button has mouse entered). Also highlight only when 1 row is selected
232. general_outputs: also printed the date & time when the problem is solved.
233. Modify button: changes would take effect immediately on click
234. Rename tooltip names of all buttons in many windows to be concise
235. output05: calculate & save are disable when SORT mode is on
236. Flow Constraints: 
	- The Sigma Spinner is reloaded when a flow is selected

	- Delete arrays xEA_E, xEA_R, xPB_E, xPB_R, xGS_E, xGS_R, xNG_E, xNG_R, xMS_E, xBS_E 
	- For defining variables: First time loop: just define & add variable to vnamelist
	- For defining variables: Second time loop: base on the compacted vnamelist --> sort, then define all compacted arrays: vname, objvals, vlb, vub, vtype with regards to the sorted vname & delete the vnamelist (set to null)
	- Anytime encounter the above arrays --> use binary search
242. Solve_Problem is now split into: Solve_Problem_Fast (without using MemoryBoost10) & Solve_Problem_Slow (using MemoryBoost10)

	- Management Cost
	- Basic Constraints
	- Flow Constraints
	- output_05_Management_Details
274. Adding void stop_editing and add that void call into buttion "New Multiple" so we do not need to press enter to register the changes when using split function. Those changes are applied to:
	- ScrollPane_ConstraintsSplitFly (add void) & Output_Panel_Management_Details (call the void when using "New Multiple" button)
	- ScrollPane_ConstraintsSplitBasic (add void) & Basic_Constraints_GUI (call the void when using "New Multiple" button)
275. Fix the exception error (when using "Copy" function in Database Management to copy tables, but "Cancel" the funtion --> error) by moving some codes into the "if then" when user presses OK.
276. Add feature "Make a copy" when a database is selected
277. Bug 18 clear by adding an if then to doMousePressed(), and rewriting applyTableNameChange & applyDatabaseNameChange

282. Dynamically load rotation ages (min and max) from yield_tables into "Covertype Conversion" window
	- Read_Database --> Read_yield_tables: add a query to save rotation info into a list (see query 2.3 in system_sql_libary for reference. Its complex)
	- Panel_EditRun_Details --> create_table_04(): dynamic loading is built by a new class "CustomComboBoxEditor"
	- QuickEdit_EA_Conversion_Panel: is rewritten to have 
		- comboboxes have the min and max calculated from rotation_ranges across all cover types
		- "apply" buttons when clicked will auto adjust the values to match with which are in the rotation_ranges of "the cover type in each selected row"
283. Some gif icons updated

293. Fix to allow import table with some records having total values less or more than the total columns headers. The fix is implemented on:
	- SQLite --> create_importTable_Stm
	- Panel_Project --> data[row][col] = (col < rowValue.length) ? rowValue[col] : "";   (when populate data matrix for table and database_table)
294. If either creating table or database-table is fail --> set both tables to null. So the click when fail would not load the previous table or database_table
295. For output_05_management_details --> Print out var_age for all variables, and var_rotation_age for EA_E variable
	- Get_Variable_Information: get_all_terms_from_name --> add age calculation for EA_R

	- Change colors: "IDLE" -->gray, "FREE" --> blue
	- ScrollPane_ConstraintsSplitBasic: always show "FREE" when popup is opened
	- ScrollPane_ConstraintsSplitBasic: also show colorful icons for bc_type in the table
	- Read_RunInputs -- > read_basic_constraints: remove IDLE line after reading input basic constraints
	- Read_RunInputs -- > get_total_freeConstraints: no need to convert null to FREE constraint anymore because in the EDIT we do not allow null bc_type anymore
299. Add popup widows to confirm delete for all delete buttons
300. Basic contraints are not allowed to delete if are currently in the flows
301. A flow constraint can be added or modified only if Flow Arragement does not contain any IDLE basic constraint
302. Changing bc_type both by directly using combox box in table9 or by using quick edit apply button:
	- Check whether IDLE constraints are in the flows
	- Auto change IDLE into FREE if they are currently used in the flows
303. Bug 20 clear (fail display when multiple projects are open) --> create 2 link buttons in Panel_Projects & remove all the static definitions.
304. Three tables in Basic Constraints, Flow Constraints, output_05 have "description" column not auto-resized & have tooltip displayed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

305. Change color of FREE flow icon to blue
306. issue 52 (BitBucket): fixed by always sorting strata_definition (--> sort by layers and layers attributes)
307. Memory Boost RR3f completed
308. Memory Boost RR3g completed
309. Memory Boost RR3h completed (all 3 boosts decreases 10% reading time, tested on SR6 HLC model)
310. Fix when basic constraints are deleted --> non-existing, but could still be added into a flow
311. Prism would automatically change IDLE basic constraints into FREE so the flow could be added or modified
312. table overview: fix showing too many digits after the dot by disabling "setMaximumFractionDigits"
313. Fix at Parameter Scroll: when Cost is check, then click on the border of the scroll --> both CostParameter and NoParameter are checked. Now, only NoParameter is checked.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

314. Decouple CPLEX
	- Panel_SolveRun (both Fast & Slow Solve): delete "nV", use "nvars" only
	- Panel_SolveRun (both Fast & Slow Solve): not use vtype anymore --> move it to "Cplex_Wrapper" class
	- "Cplex_Wrapper"is a new class, created to mimic CPLEX functions (sometimes, several functions are combined into a void). This class is put into a new java project "prismcplex". The readme.txt in this project would describe detailed steps for the connection between "Prism" and "Cplex" through "prismcplex"
	- Panel_SolveRun (both Fast & Slow Solve): also load cplex.jar dynamically in Temporary folder C:\\Users\\...\cplex.jar so CPLEX could be run when working in Eclipse IDE
315. GS_E and GS_R --> choices 0 to 5.
316. Fix to correct output_04 printing out when LPSOLVE is used as solver
317. Bug 21 fixed: when we dont have or lack data in rotation age ranges (rotation_ranges) then import in EDIT RUN fails:  ---> re-upload as PrismAlpha1.0.31.jar
	- Fix in create_table4
	- QuickEdit_EA_Conversion_Panel
318. refactor almost all packages and classes
319. In Panel_SolveRun: not using "setLibraryPath" any more, just use "addLibraryPath". Reasons are:
	- It seems like set will clear everything and keep only the path we set to.
	- need to not use cplex****.dll in the Temporary folder of the eclipse IDE --> add that dll file in a fixed location in my computer for convenient working
320. Update Eclipse Neon --> Eclipse Oxygen so Java SE-9 could be used in Eclipse IDE
	- https://moduliertersingvogel.de/2017/07/30/update-eclipse-from-neon-to-oxygen/
	- https://dzone.com/articles/working-with-java-9-in-eclipse
321. Change default execution environment to Java SE-9 (jre-9.04)for both projects: prism & prismcplex --> need to check if there are some improvements in Prism performance.
322. Fix some places that is not compiled due to new Java SE-9 (happned only on Jtree): Enumeration<TreeNode> is used, and (DefaultMutableTreeNode) is used to cast e.nextElement()
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.32.jar, Prism Formulation 02.docx, Prism Database 02.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

323. Fix to enable/disable (unfaded/faded) layer title when the scrollpane border is clicked (select/deselect all items). Apply on: ScrollPane_StaticIdentifiers
324. Re-arrange cplex_wrapper to be in one place so memory could be cleared before writting outputs; also clear arrays right after each "cplex_wrapper.addRows" to manage memory better
325. Also print out "fail" in the table in Solve window when the problem is infeasible
326. Set default % for non-replacing and replacing disturbances to 0%
327. Update dependent library: SQLite 3.8 --> SQlite 3.21, license is also updated to Apache 2.0
328. Update dependent library: CPLEX 12.61 --> CPLEX 12.80 (just in dzung's testing computer, users could do the same if they have the jar and dll files)
329. Update dependent library: TableFilter 5.3.0 --> 5.3.1, readme in license folder is also updated
330. Panel_Projects --> doMousePressed: Clear memory after reading file & loading into Jtable 
331. Update all queries (system library in management_details & Database Management, and query in Read_Database) to use escape '_'
332. output_06: not printing out bookeeping any more (i.e. bookeeping_var_id --> var_id, etc.)
333. Some more of clear arrays in prismcplex & prism (after: cplex_wrapper = new prismcplex.Cplex_Wrapper)
334. Add some queries for output_05 (populate output_04 and more)
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.33.jar, Prism Formulation 03.docx, Prism Database 03.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

335. Queries in output_05 System Library: 
	- acres --> area
	- Round to 1 digit after the dot
	- show only value > 0
	- table has RIGHT alignment
	- move the codes to create database _table from Panel_Projects --> Output_Panel_Management_Details_SQL (set_up_database_table()), also simplify the class call
336. Put DomousePressed on Project window to thread again, but thread now is submitted by ExecutorService
337. Inject executor to the class Output_Panel_Management_Details_NOSQL: reason is when querying results, then click on other tables in the project tree --> the thread to get_results is still going on. We need it stopped by injecting executor inside this class.
338. Remove thread when click Edit Runs in Panel_Projects (not necessary using thread here)
339. Rewrite Executor Service in Panel_EditRun (simplifier, and use 4 threads in the Pool)
340. Combobox in "General Inputs" GUI will now have only CPLEX & LPSOLVE selectable, the other inactive solvers are faded in gray. Tool tips are also shown
341. For the query_value in NOSQL mode (output_05) --> set alignment to RIGHT and accuracy to 1 digit after the dot
342. PrismTextAreaReadMe: Fix the bug of failed color JTextArea when changing Look and Feel --> by using transparent color only for Nimbus, but not others LAFs.
343. Activate line 179 in PrismMain class to fix the bug when clicking File --> Open fails right after changing Look and Feel when running PRISM in Eclipse IDE
344. Fix Screen Capture (Note 5 in issue 18 in BitBucket) by:
	- removing all listeners of all components in the GUI
	- add those listeners back after 5s capture is done
	- add an if then so another Screen Capture thread will not start if the previous thread is still not completed
345. Fix Font Change (Note 4 in issue 18 in BitBucket) by:
	- Add 1 more line in the file prism_memory (3rd line) with Font Name and Font Size, separated by tab
	- Change the codes in PrismMain to load the Font in the above file when starting Prism runnable jar
	- Change the codes in OptionPane_Startup to capture the new line set up
346. Change Look and Feel now will not change Font (keep the old Font of the previous LAFs)
347. Set Font feature: users have option to set Font to default, and are able to see Font illustration on the fly
348. PaintComponent is applied for some GUI components. Looks Great! Especially the content_panel
349. About Prism --> hide all internal frames on click, show again when done
350. ALways enable Database_Management MenuItem, ALT + D would show the internalframe it it was already created
351. Simplify the codes for looping displayed internalframes for many purposes in PrismMain
352. Image Capture is now having a pop-up panel to confirm
353. Image Capture now will not show up on right click if you click on the JMenu (i.e. File, Utility, Window, Help) by not adding the listener to JMenu. This is to prevent the popup mess when JMenu is clicked when Capture Mode is on
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.0.34.jar, Prism Formulation 03.docx, Prism Database 03.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

354. Simplify codes in MenuItem_SetFont (trim to be more concise)
355. Revert 342, can now use transparent background and foreground in PrismTextAreaReadMe. The reason is to show same color painted in different LAFs
356. public void update_regen_percentage_column() --> now allow all 0
357. Allow ALT + D --> both open and close the "Database Management" internal frame
358. When open an attribute column for cost (Quick Edit: use the binocular button) --> refresh UI with active columns only (by using radioButton[1].doClick();)
359. Extend total number of planning periods to 99
360. Stand-replacing disturbance redesign:
	- Formulation: huge changes
		- Use new definitions for replacing-percentage parameters (all kinds of P)
		- Change 7b, 8b, 9b, 11, 14a, 14b, 14c, 14d
		- Remove 12b, modify 12a and change 12a --> 12
		- Rewrite indexes in eq. 13, both in formulation and codes
	- GUI:
		- Add total replacing disturbances combo box to "General Inputs". Limit total number of replacing disturbances up to 99
		- Replacing distubances GUI uses both static identifiers and dynamic identifiers, and has the ability to define occurence probability & regeneration distribution (percentage)
		- Invisible disturbances (unused) still have the information saved
	- Code: huge changes
		- Panel_EditRun: Modify Natural Disturbances to capture new GUI for replacing disturbances with 2 tables for probability and regeneration
		- Panel_EditRun: --> "Natural Disturbance" class: --> listener should be used for Radiobutton[4] 
		- Add class: Get_Disturbance_Information
		- Panel_SolveRun: Always process replacing disturbaces and cost at the start of solving process, then use later
		- Panel_SolveRun: Simplify codes for eq. 15 constraints
		- Output_Panel_Management_Details_NOSQL (output_05): change the codes (closed to codes in Panel_SolveRun) to implement new replacing disturbance logic
		- Get_Parameter_Information: static --> non static. This reduces memory consumption while solving (i.e. HLC_SR6 model has peak memory reduced from 19G --> 16G)
		- Simplify void call method in many places
		- Refactors in many places
361. VERY IMPORTANT: change read yield tables in class Read_Database:  need to order by both prescription and row_id --> All models without row_id inthe database will not be able to load to solve any more (example SYL_9_20)
362. use try catch for solving so if it is fail the button,... come back to normal status (no animation...)
363. output_05 table has percentages from all SR disturbances written, and also management cost per area unit written (i.e. per acre). This is to support future queries
364. table2, 7, 8, 10 now have description columns not auto resize to avoid very long line after auto description is added. this column has tooltip show up

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
			VERSION IS NOW 1.1.01
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

365. Fix printing out wrong percentages for MS, BS, EA with period = rotation_period in output_05. Fixed (line 1172 in Panel_SolveRun)  --> exported as PrismAlpha1.0.02
366. Allow replacing disturbances on MS and BS areas. Now, only EA_E and EA_R where the final activity is implemented (period = rotation period) would not be subjected to SR
	- Change formulation: 6c, 6e, 12
	- Change codes
		- Panel_SolveRun: add loss percentage for 6c, 6e, and add MS and BS variables for 12
		- Get_Cost_Information: remove the exclusion of MS and BS in "are_all_static_identifiers_matched" --> means include MS and BS into the regeneration conversion cost calculation (since SR can now happen in MS and BS areas)
		- Get_Disturbance_Information: remove the exclusion of MS and BS in "are_all_static_identifiers_matched" --> means MS and BS areas could be subjected to SR
		- Panel_SolveRun: In the place where we calculate all costs for all variables: remove the exclusion of MS and BS --> means include MS and BS into the regeneration conversion cost calculation
		- Output_Panel_Management_Details_NOSQL: In the place where we calculate all costs for all variables: remove the exclusion of MS and BS --> means include MS and BS into the regeneration conversion cost calculation
367. Move the sort for unique_values_list from ScrollPane_DynamicIdentifiers --> Read_Database: get_col_unique_values_list
368. Output_Panel_Management_Details_NOSQL --> Querry_Optimal_Solution  --> Simplify get_results() by using var_unit_management_cost column. It is now much more faster to do calculation on cost (i.e. using CostParameter).
All the above associated with Prism Formulation 05.docx

369. Rearrange model formulation: note same objetive optimal solution, but different variables solution values --> OK
	- 2, 3 --> 2a, 2b
	- 4a, 4b --> 3a, 3b
	- 5 --> 16
	- 6a --> 5
	- 6b, 6c --> 10a, 10b
	- 6d, 6e --> 11a, 11b
	- 7a, 7b --> 6a, 6b
	- 8a, 8b --> 7a, 7b
	- 9a, 9b --> 8a, 8b
	- 10, 11 --> 9a, 9b

370. LPSolve now returns all outputs except output 03.
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.1.04.jar, Prism Formulation 06.docx, Prism Database 03.docx	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

371. Activate layer5 for regenerated strata
	- rewrite "are_all_static_identifiers_matched()" in:
		- Output_Panel_Management_Details_NOSQL (for output_05)
		- Get_Cost_Information (for cost)
		- Get_Disturbance_Information (for replacing disturbances)
	- For Basic Constraints & Silviculture Method
			- sm now need 5 layers when read this input: sm_strata_without_sizeclass, sm_method_choice_for_strata_without_sizeclass, 
			- activate "model_strata_without_sizeclass" (this is a special case not the one calculated from model_strata since all cover types could be regenerated)
			- all regeneration variables and replacing variables reduce 1 dimension (layer5 --> merge into model_strata_without_sizeclass)
			- use strata_5layers_id when defining regeneration variables and replacing variables (currently fire is used to indicate replacing variables)
			- Rewrite equations: 12, 13, 14, 15
	- Change color of the layer5 in the GUI: red --> black
372. Rewrite eq (12) to use only 1 strata check for all existing variables --> same obj function optimal value but different details are expected. CGNF PA_21_15 speeds up 20 seconds (2mins --> 1min40)
373. Remove the sort of each layer in Panel_SolveRun because we already sort it by the query in Read_strata_definition() in Read_Database
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.1.05.jar, Prism Formulation 07.docx, Prism Database 03.docx	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

374. Some more optimization for speeding up constraints 12 nad 15 (loop using index not string for 12 & 15, 2 arrays to store original indexes for 15)
375. Rewrite static identifiers boolean check in a different way, a little bit faster.
376. Jagged array Memory Boost 7:
	- Implemented for EA_E variables with changes made for variable-definitions and equations 9a, 9b, 12, 13, 15. Also remove rotation & conversion check to speed up run time
	- Implemented for EA_R variables with changes made for variable-definitions and equations 12, 13, 14d, 15. Also remove rotation & conversion check to speed up run time
	- Implemented for NG_R, PB_R, GS_R variables with changes made for variable-definitions and equations 12, 13, 14abc, 15
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.1.06.jar, Prism Formulation 07.docx, Prism Database 03.docx	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------	

377. RR Boost 7 completed: static --> non-static for Get_Variables_Information
378. For all constraints, variables are added only when parameter is not zero (6b, 7b, 8b, 9b, 10b, 11b, 12, 14, 15). This is a memory boost
379. Jagged array Memory Boost 7 - continue: 
	- Implemented for NG_E, PB_E, GS_E, MS_E, BS_E variables with changes made for variable-definitions and equations 12, 15 and 6ab, 7ab, 8ab, 10ab, 11ab
380. Remove many binary search when defining variables
381. New GUI for readme.txt to be edited without erasing the outputs
381. Modify output_05:
	- Rewrite a number of places to make the output_05 compatible with the double boosts 7
	- move executor services to submit inside the for loop of btn_GetResult, also add revalidate & repaint for some GUI components --> This would help fix bug in issue 79 in BitBucket.
382. Permanently delete the second solving option (slow run time - large scale) since the fast option has a very good memory & speed management)
383. Refactor:
	- Panel_EditRun_Details --> Panel_Edit_Details
	- Panel_EditRun --> Panel_Edit
	- Panel_SolveRun --> Panel_Solve
384. Change to add variables when parameters is not 0 ( not > or < 0) to allow errors show up (i.e. set up U conversion 200% --> infeasible). Changes were made for eq. 6b, 7b, 8b, 9b, 10b, 11b, 12, 14abcd
385. Binary search is implemented for:
	- RR Boost 3i: populate_sm_lists() in Read_RunInputs class --> Significantly reduce time for reading inputs
	- RR Boost 3j: checking methods and choices when defining variables (sm_strata & sm_strata_without_sizeclass)
	- Note: This boost requires to re-do the Silviculture Method for CGNF tests since the static identifiers in earlier versions were not sorted by the old UI --> Recommenrdation: rebuild new models from scratch, do not copy the too old models in the past to edit in Alpha1.1.07. The sorted UI seems appeared from 1.1.01 (not sure)
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.1.07.jar, Prism Formulation 07.docx, Prism Database 03.docx	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------	

386. Improve the speed of finding unique values in dynamic identifiers by using Set in "get_col_unique_values_list" in "Read_Database". E.g. 12k unique values of culmmai can be found in 2 secs instead of 4 secs.
387. Disable yield_tables columns if not found any number when the columns are used in:
	- Parameters (in many GUIs)
	- Quick Edit in Management Cost (binocular button)
388. output_05 NOSQL MODEL now only calculate results of the selected rows (issue 60 BitBucket)
389. Panel_Edit --> temporarily use Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1) to avoid fail reloading multiple runs. The cause might probably be because of database connection limit --> prevent loading when too many databases are read at the same time in multiple threads
390. Reselect the runs after editing or solving
391. Readme can now be saved without erasing the outputs
392. fly_constraints is now not deleted after saving edit, and will have query_value cleared whenever solving is completed (regardless of fail or successful solve)
393. Intersect model_strata vs sm_strata to remove binary search for sm_method_choice_for_strata --> reduce runtime (reading time)
394. Now delete all output files if solving fails (previously delete only 4 output files when solving fails).
395. Radio buttons are redesigned. Following files in each model run are required to rename:
	- input_02_silviculture_method.txt --> input_03_non_ea_management.txt
	- input_03_model_strata.txt --> input_02_model_strata.txt
	- input_04_covertype_conversion_clearcut.txt --> input_04_ea_management.txt
	- input_06_natural_disturbances_non_replacing.txt --> input_05_non_sr_disturbances.txt
	- input_07_natural_disturbances_replacing.txt --> input_06_sr_disturbances.txt
	- input_08_management_cost.txt --> input_07_management_cost.txt
	- input_09_basic_constraints.txt --> input_08_basic_constraints.txt
	- input_10_flow_constraints.txt --> input_09_flow_constraints.txt
396. Fix double scroll bars when Dynamic Identifiers height is resized to be too short
397. Many places refactored and deleted
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.1.08.jar, Prism Formulation 07.docx, Prism Database 03.docx	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------	

398. Rewrite the Double sort (Read_Database --> Read_yield_tables) to show the sorted list correctly even if the yield attribute has both numeric and non-numeric cells (i.e. cumlmai)
399. Disable table filter in output_07_flow_constraints
400. Fix the bug where switch button does not show when single click then double click the output_05 (reason: the GUI process is not finished after the single click)
	- rewrite codes when click on output_05 (move codes into the thread)
	- add a boolean variable: "is_output_05_processing" so the executor does not shut down if the GUI is still processing
401. Rename & add more intuitive information (tool tips, column headers, description, etc) for many tables in Prism GUI
402. ScrollPane_SubTables_SR_Disturbances --> reload_this_condition_occurence_and_regeneration --> rewrite to trim unnecessary codes which make it really slow when reloading information (reason for slower is same as 403 with too many fireTableDataChanged when we add too many rows/cells to selection)
403. Fix cell value not change when enter in many tables. See "setValueAt(Object value, int row, int col)" which is rewritten for each table. 2 cases:
	- 1st case to re-select cell: tables fixed: 6a, 6b, 8a, 8b (also fix quick edit, see button apply)
	- 2nd case to re-select row: tables fixed: 4a (not fix quick edit of this table because there are many buttons & the data is small anyway so the speed is still fast)
404. Special desgin for moving basic constraints and fly constraints (output_05) to see 3-gap-rows at top or bottom while moving the constraints up or down
405. Rewrite read input sm so we do not need to intersect strata later (see populate_sm_lists in Read_Inputs) --> alternative optimal solution
406. Boost speed RR3k with Binary search:
	- when matching method and choice (of input_03) when defining variables
	- when matching covertype conversion & rotation age (of input_04) when defining variables
407. Need to disable quick edit buttons when multiple rows in the following tables are selected (to avoid not being aware of making changes)
	- Management Cost
	- SR Disturbances
	- EA Management
408. Reqrite eq. 15 in Panel_Solve in a different way. Alternative optimal solution is accepted
409. RRB9 Speed Boost is implemented in several place, not significant improvement
	- Get_Disturbance_Information
	- Get_Cost_Information
	- Read_Inputs --> populate_nonea_lists
410. Permanaetly remove the boolean colum in input_nonea_management
411. GUI for EA Management window completed. Note:
	- choices are limited to 0-5 for both EA_E and EA_R
	- no row --> not model EA_E and EA_R
412. Extent choices limit to 0-14 for NG, PB, GS, MS, BS methods. Note: no row --> not model Non-EA methods

413. Update eclipse build-path to the newest java JDK10
414. Set null border to all split_pane in all EDIT GUI components to make components better aligned (Note: could see the bad alignment when setting LAF to windows)
415. All the numbers in Basic constraints, Flow constraints, and Fly constraints (output_05) are not allowed to be negative, but are allowed to be null (change directly or by quick edit). This guarantees users would not be able to make the mistake as described in Note 1 of issue #18 in BitBucket
416. Fix the flow constraint logic bug when the same bc_id is added (multiple times/duplicated) into the same Sigma box.
417. Add tooltips for all tables in output_07_flow_constraints. Also, rewrite the tooltips in multiple tables in EDIT window to avoid returning null case of the table-cell
418. Rewrite dynamic identifiers to avoid blinking during calculation in output_05 NOSQL Mode (avoid making invisible all then visible the ones needed because this might be likely the cause of bliking. Instead each time reloading dynamic identifiers, we keep the old scrollpanes visible if they are still going to be reloaded)
419. Ctrl+3 can be used to hide/show tooltips for the entire software
420. Right click to save readme (Model Description) without deleting outputs. This feature is applied everywhere (inside/outside of EDIT window). Button "save" is removed to simplify UI.
421. Facts & Hints maequee feature
422. Rename SpectrumLibrary.csv --> yield_dictionary.csv and also move the file reading to FilesHandle class
423. Disable then enable tool-tips when mouse exited for buttons in the Toolbar of Panel_Project to avoid tool-tips keep staying & become annoying
424. All the Rotator class is rewritten in a new way using executor.scheduleAtFixedRate: simpler, faster, no lag, memory efficient.
425. Spectrum light feature:
	- ContentPane (background) is tranparent as default
	- MenuBar, Menus, and MenuItems show dark UI when spectrum light is showing
	- Left click to stop and start, right click to change speed
426. Many refactors: class rename, class trim, etc.
427. Key stroke on release only (previously it is repeated if holding shortcut key --> very bad)
428. Change behavior os static identifiers, dynamic identifiers to select checkboxes when they are selected, visible, and enabled
429. Static identifiers completed for non-stand-replacing disturbances.
430. Disable the control of MS_E and BS_E in Non-EA Management.

431. Flow description is added using examine button. Support examining one flow at a time.
432. Bug 16 fixed with a lot of code restructure. Support reverting data when database importation fails. Remember database only when database importation is successful.
433. Add infeasibility check for Non-SR Disturbances, SR Disturbances, Hard Basic Constraints, Hard Flow Constraints (with icon & tooltip for description of infeasibility)
434. Progess animation when loading models

436. Update eclipse build-path to the newest java JDK11
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.2.05.jar, User Manual 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

437. Update eclipse build-path to the newest java JDK12 (JDK12 has upgrades on G1 and also introduces Shenandoah GC, https://stackify.com/java-12-new-features-and-enhancements-developers-should-know/)
438. Optimize the memory wasted by using:-XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication (both in Eclipse Runtime & OptionPane_Startup, https://dzone.com/articles/easy-change-to-reduce-memory-by-20)
439. Refactor in many places:
	- rename variables in Panel_Edit_Details
	- rename variables in Read_Database
	- delete class: Cplex_Wrapper_Not_Use (in "solve" package)
440. Panel_Solve: 
	- using "Switch" instead of "if then" to add -y(j) or -z(k) or -v(n) --> this speeds up reading user constraints
	- change for loop to not use ".size" in the loop --> this speeds up the loop (i.e. layer5.size() --> total_layer5)
441. Get_Variable_Information: using "Switch" instead of "if then"
442. Speed up in Read_Inputs --> (get_static_strata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype & get_static_strata_without_sizeclass & get_static_strata). This is a very significant speed improvements.
	- use Set 
	- use String builder
	- remove contain method 
	- use for each loop
443. Rewrite the class "Get_Cost_Information" to improve the speed of splitting Strings significantly by using tokenizer (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/691184/scanner-vs-stringtokenizer-vs-string-split/691224#691224). Tokenizer is applied on:
	- get_condition_action_cost
	- get_condition_conversion_cost
	- get_condition_static_identifiers
	- get_condition_dynamic_identifiers
	- get_condition_dynamic_dentifiers_column_indexes
444. Remove contain method, use checking the first element of the list where possible. applied on (dynamic_identifiers_column_indexes & parameters_indexes) located at:
	- Get_Cost_Information
	- Get_Parameter_Information
	- Get_Disturbance_Information
445. Improve for loop:
	- Put the .length out of the for loop in eq.15 in Panel_Solve (only appplied on xEA_E and xEA_R to make it easier for code maintainance)
	- Put the .length out of the for loop in eq.15 in Panel_Solve appplied on model_strata & model_strata_without_sizeclass)
	- Put the .size out of the for loop (are_all_dynamic_identifiers_matched in 3 different classes)
	- Use for each loop in Get_Parameter_Information --> get_total_value
Note for Updating SQLITE to version 3.27.2: There are some good functions, e.g. rename table column, but NOTE NOTE NOTE: query for rotation_age fail in Database management --> will not apply SQLITE update
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.2.06.jar, User Manual 1.03.21, will update later when the newer version is better)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

446. Use tokenizer to read the text file to show in the table view (Panel_Project)
447. Rewrite the "create_import_table_statement" in SQLite class:
	- use String.join()
	- remove the "a" array, use list instead
448. Integrate Kira's update with check and uncheck buttons for several inputs
	- Fix the bug unsolvable model due to removing the first line of the list twice (input_06_sr_disturbances & input_07_management_cost in Read_Inputs class)
	- Fix the bug frozen table non_sr_disturbance --> fix the if then condition at setValueAt, fix the icon warning if then condition for columns 2 and 3 only and reactivate the code Kira disabled.
	- Rename function "get_Include" --> "get_list_of_checked_conditions", and also rewrite the whole function to have better logic
	- Rename "Include" --> "model_condition"
	- For function of mass check and mass uncheck --> update table overview only when checking or unchecking implemented in table3
	- Switch positions of check and uncheck buttons in Non-EA-Management window and EA-Management window so the UIs are consistent with other windows
	- Remove border of check and uncheck button in all input windows, use the button effects as being used in Model Strata input
	- Fix the wrong match_data_type for table6 and table8 (write true & false to wrong column)
	- Fix the create_mass_check_button & create_mass_uncheck_button in Management_Cost_GUI class
	- Fix writing the error incorrectly (i.e. in create_table2) and carelessly (i.e. create_table4) 
	- Trim bad "backward compatibility" code in "reload_inputs", remove "handle_old_file" and instead use the new code added in "Reload_Table_Info" (code could be easily deleted in the future after having all models loaded and saved into new format)
449. Revert tokenizer which lead to wrong data show up in the table and other potential problems (see issue 102 in BitBucket)
	- Revert tokenizer in Panel_Projects (446)
450. Code clean up, refactor, restructure:
	- Rewrite "reload_inputs" in "Panel_Edit_Details"
	- Input_02_model_strata is now saved with both false and true strata (previously only save the true model_strata): fix create_table3 & create_file_input_02
	- remove "is_the_first_time_loading_a_run"
	- Read_Inputs: add code to remove the false model_strata from the list
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.2.07.jar, User Manual 1.03.21, will update later when the newer version is better)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

451. Flexible strata recognition update:
	a. Modify string handling methods (join, split, merge, substring, contain, etc.)
	- Read_Inputs --> get_model_strata: use String.join by "_"
	- Read_Inputs --> get_model_strata_without_sizeclass: use String.join by "_"
	- Read_Inputs --> get_model_strata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype: use String.join by "_"
	- Read_Inputs --> populate_nonea_lists: use String.split to replace substring
	- Read_Inputs --> populate_ea_lists: use String.split to replace substring
	- Read_Inputs --> populate_non_sr_lists: use String.split to replace substring
	- Read_Inputs --> get_static_strata: use String.join by "_"
	- Read_Inputs --> get_static_strata_without_sizeclass: use String.join by "_"
	- Read_Inputs --> get_static_strata_without_sizeclass_and_covertype: use String.join by "_"
	- Panel_Solve --> input_02_model_strata: join 4 layers with layer 5 by "_"
	- Panel_Solve --> Create decision variables: remove "layers_merged_name" and the substring, also join by "_" instead of ","
	- Panel_Solve --> many equations: use strata.split("_") (NOTE NOTE NOTE this might slow down the reading process, if it is --> we need to change the code)
	- Panel_Solve --> when writing output_05_management_details: padd x and underscore for the method so the string.contain could work correctly (e.g. NG --> xNG_, PB --> 		- Output_Panel_Management_Details_NOSQL --> Fly_Constraints_GUI -- When process all the variables in output05: substring with fixed position of var_name is replaced by var_name.split by "_"
	- Get_Variable_Information: split by "_"
	b. Modify existing strata requirements:
	- Read_Database --> Read_existing_strata: modify the queries	
	- Model Strata GUI (table3): "acres" --> area
	- Model Strata GUI (table3): strata_id will be automatically generated regardless of user has data on it or not (ignore about strata_id column in existing_strata file)
	c.Revise SQL queries:
	- database SQL system library: revise all queries and replace the file "dbms_system_sql_library.txt". 
	- Read_Database --> get_rotation_ranges: modify the query to get rotation information (the 2.3 in "dbms_system_sql_library.txt", different way to write escape)
	d. .............on going: Update the Prism-UserManual-01 --> Prism-UserManual-02
452. Refactor:
	- Rename class:
		- Read_inputs --> Read_Input
		- Get_Cost_Information --> Information_Cost
		- Get_Disturbance_Information --> Information_Disturbance
		- Get_Parameter_Information --> Information_Parameter
		- Get_Variable_Information --> Information_Variable
	- Rename variables in "Read_input" class and "Panel_Solve" class
	- Simplify method: Read_Input --> get_list_of_checked_conditions: remove the "model_condition_col" requirement from method call
453. Modify UI components:
	- Narrower condition_description column in EA_Management window (300 -->200)
	- Taller Project and Database Management internal frames (to remove internal bar due to adding the mass check and mass uncheck buttons)
454. Panel_Solve & Output_Panel_Management_Details_NOSQL: remove the assumption age_class = 1 if not found yield_table. This is because only strata where yield_table is found could be checked as model_strata
455. Fix the table overview information update: when the data is loaded the first time, information on the table overview will now show up immediately
456. Fix the bug in EA_Management screen where many combo boxes in the Quick Edit side window would show negative values. This is because of using the incorrect usage of list.remove in Panel_QuickEdit_EA
457. Fix the bug: Using lower-case letters for layer5 and/or layer6 would cause an issue of Prism unable to find associated prescription (https://bitbucket.org/Prism-Members/prism/issues/103/using-lower-case-letters-for-layer5-and-or)
....need to check more for upper case.......................

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

458. Total replacing disturbances update (confirmation by a popup window, faster speed since data is now associated with only the SRs defined instead of with all 99 SRs previously):
	- Fix reload_this_condition_occurrence_and_regeneration: load up to the current number of SRs so old runs which have full data of all 99 disturbances could be loaded
	- get_occurrence_info_from_GUI & get_regeneration_info_from_GUI: edited with better code
	- Listener of the SR_Disturbances_GUI: remove the unnecessary table handle show/hide since the new instance of SR_Disturbances_GUI is created
	- Action apply in General_Input_GUI: add the popup window to allow confirmation of the change of the total SRs (new instance of SR_Disturbances_GUI would be created when apply)
459. Add compact view functionality to EA Management screen:
	- The functionality icon has 2 view modes: compact view (show only active/checked options that would be implemented) and full view (show all options that would be feasible for implementation)
	- The view mode would also need to be updated when resetting data to default or doing a multiple/mass implementation checks in the Quickedit side window
	- Sorting table is active on "compact view"
	- ScrollPane_SubTable_EA_Management -- reload_this_table: The current method makes the processing really slow when clicking any row on table4. The speed enhancement is implemented by removing the usage of Object conversion and move the table4a.match_Datatype to outside of the for loop.
	- Cells with value of -9999 would be displayed as blanlk cells
460. Add compact view functionality to SR Disturbances screen:
	- The functionality icon has 2 view modes: compact view (show only rows have at least one non-zero) and full view (show all rows)
	- The view mode would also need to be updated when editting the data by using the Quickedit side window
	- Sorting table is active on "compact view"
	- Warning icons and tooltip message needs to be fixed to displayed the infeasibility correctly
	- Rearrange items in the QuickEdit side window
461. Add compact view functionality to Management Cost screen:
	- The functionality icon has 2 view modes: compact view (show only rows have at least one non-null) and full view (show all rows)
	- The view mode would also need to be updated when editting the data by using the Quickedit side window
	- Sorting table is active on "compact view"
	- Rearrange items in the QuickEdit side window
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.2.09.jar, Prism-Formulation-08.docx, Prism-UserManual-01.docx)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
462. Read_Database: move the if then check for database file out of sub methods and add null check to clear the popup error
463. Read_Database & Panel_DatabaseManagement & Setting: Remove the deprecated method call: Class.forName("org.sqlite.JDBC").newInstance();
464. Panel_Edit_Details:
	- Simplify functions code for buttons: mass check, mass uncheck, sort.
	- Simplify code for create input files
	- Remove Sort function for Non-SR Disturbances screen because Sort would cause misleading for priority condition
	- Compact button is changed to switch view button with tooltip added and listener activated on tooltip name change
	- radio_panel: setPreferredSize to avoid horizonal scroll due to too many radio buttons
	- Create a class (Table_Interaction) to implement the same method used in mouse click_release and table selection change
	- Remove private definitions of some variables obtained from read_database to avoid getting back data in multiple places
	- Change some table definitions (indexes of row, col, data, model, name, etc.) to be incremental (changes are also made in many other classes within the edit package)
	- create_table1: Rewrite create_table1 to have full inputs for data1 to load to interface. General_Inputs_GUI: rewrite the way to load data1 to interface
465. Update SQLite from version 3.21 to version 3.27.2.1
	- Replacing the SQLite jar file
	- Modify queries 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 in the DBMS System Library (dbms_system_sql_library.txt) to work with SQLite 3.27.2.1
	- Modify  query 2.3 in Read_Database to work with SQLite 3.27.2.1
466. Important changes to getting data from yield tables (changes made in many classes in Prism)
	- yield_tables_values[][][]: Object is replaced by String
	- yield_tables_names[]: Object is replaced by String
467. Rolling horizon: area merging feature completed
468. Java is updated to JDK 13
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.3.01.jar, Prism-Formulation-08.docx, Prism-UserManual-01.docx)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
469. Fix the bug: https://bitbucket.org/Prism-Members/prism/issues/110/incomplete-data-when-saving-and-loading
470. Update codebase to implement the Prism-Formulation-09 (Panel_Solve)
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha1.3.02.jar, Prism-Formulation-09.docx, Prism-UserManual-01.docx)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
471. Remove original_id for strata and strata_5layers and use linkhashmaps to retrieve the original id
472. Separate solving process to a new class (Solving_Iterations) and set to null after solving to save memory
473. When start solving, all output files will be deleted
474. When click the Save buttons (Save Runs), input_11_state_id will be automatically created and saved.
475. Apply rolling horizon for Formulation-09 based on 3a:
	- For iteration iter, create variables in the range[1 + iter, T + iter]. Note that in the code total number of period and age need +1 since we loop from period 1 and age 1
	- Modify all equations to capture variables in relavant periods of the iteration that is currently processing
	- Discount rate for t + iter is calculated for period t
	- All input requirements for period t is translated as requirements for period t + iter (SR Disturbances, Management Cost, Basic Constraints)
	- Build mechanism to create input_11_state_id and read it to linkhashmap when solving (map_prescription_and_row_id_to_state_id in Read_Input class)
	- Build mapping mechanism for constraint (5) with the map_var_index_to_var_state_id LinkedHashMap
476. Simple summarize_output_01 and summarize_output_06
477. Export just a general output_05 (not details with all yield_tables attributes) 
478. Interface to allow restart solving from iteration 0 or continue solving from the last solved iteration.
479. null state_id is replace by "" because null will make stream sort failed
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha2.0.01.jar, Prism-Formulation-09.docx, Rolling horizon-formulation-05.docx, Prism-UserManual-01.docx)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
480. Method to summarize by union of all output files and its application on output_04_management_overview
481. Bug fix
	- Add if condition in xEA_R variable definition and equation 14d (note that we could not include 2 conditions into for loop with && because the loop will behave incorrectly)
	- Remove if condition (if (1 + iter == tR - aR + 1)) in 5a no-merge, 5d merge, output_04
482. Method to summarize applies on output_07 and the graphs are now working for both the summary and the independent iteration's output_07_flow_constraint
483. Graphs are now available for the summarize_output_06_basic_constraints
484. Modify the legend display for all charts of the output_07_flow_constraint
485. Add the i index of the loop as String.valueOf(i) for dataset, chart name, etc in summary_output_06_flow_constraint
486. Fix frozen chart in summary_output_06_flow_constraint when the data has only 1 dataset (1 iteration). This happens when users solve only iteration zero
487. UIs for charts of output_06 and output_07 display and behave the same way
488. icon changes for the JTree nodes to notify whether the output could be represented by graph-charts or not
489. Fix counting the last_soved_iteration from output_01, and fix deleting the output without iteration index (in Solve_Iterations)
490. Activate the no-merge option when either 1) input_10 and input_11 do not exist 2) input_10 and input_11 do exist but all the state_id is blank (note that BLANK is not NUll, Read_Input - read_state_id). Read_Input - read_state_id is customized to make map_prescription_and_row_id_to_state_id null when the read is failed. null map would consequently apply the no-merge option. Otherwise (not null map) merge option would be applied.
491. Summarize output_06 and output_07 only when the outputs exist
492. New classes - Chart and Char_Rotator to simplify the summarize_output_06 and summarize_output_07 codes and create potential future usage. 
493. Output_Panel_Flow_Constraints - Separate the refresh of legend table when clicking on either single or multiple charts. This help trim code significantly.
494. Graphs are now available for the summarize_output_04_management_overview
495. Customized colors for pie chart of the summarize_output_04_management_overview
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha2.0.02.jar, Prism-Formulation-09.docx, Rolling horizon-formulation-05.docx, Prism-UserManual-01.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
496. gitignore files are added to prevent tracking (i.e. add to index) files in Databases, Projects folders and also the bfg-1.13.0.jar in prism folder
497. Modify the description of area merging to describe exactly what is currently applying
498. Hide button Examine in the basic constraints GUI since it has no function
499. Stochastic disturbances update
	- Add scenario_id and scenario_probability columns
	- Hide occurence_probability column
	- Extend the length of condition_description column
	- New UI including table and chart to help define probability for scenarios
500. Revert to previous interface and setup for SR Disturbance (commit to stochastic_disturbances_02 and switch to stochastic_disturbances_03)
501. Stochastic disturbances new update:
	- Initially establish 4 tables for SR Disturbances: lpr_mean, lpr_std, cr_mean, cr_std (commit to stochastic_disturbances_03 and switch to stochastic_disturbances_04)
	- synchronize both view and selection for 2 pairs of tables: (lpr_mean, lpr_std) and (cr_mean, cr_std)
	- rename loss probability to loss rate and apply in the UI (also lpr to lr)
	- make the 4 tables updated correctly when changing (increasing or decreasing) the total number of replacing disturbances in the General Inputs screen (commit to stochastic_disturbances_04 and switch to stochastic_disturbances_05)
	- modify the UI (header, tooltip, etc.) for 4 tables
	- modify size for 6 sub tables in SR Disturbances and Management Cost screens
	- all 4 tables have the default mean and standard deviation of zero
	- Information_disturbance class would now read all the 4 information (lpr_mean, lpr_std, cr_mean, cr_std)
	- Panel_Solve_Iterations: logic is modified to integrate lpr_mean and cr_mean into solving process
	- Read the output_02_variables_ only when iteration >= 1 to avoid error report (occurs when reading the previous iteartion file when current iteration is 0) (commit to stochastic_disturbances_05 and switch to stochastic_disturbances_06)
502. Auto convert SR Disturbances input from old model (2.0.02 and before) to new model (2.0.03) (convert to get lr_mean, cr_mean and make lr_std and cr_std to be 20% of the associated mean) (commit to stochastic_disturbances_06 and switch to stochastic_disturbances_07)
503. Fix equation 6d in the code to loop t from 1 + iter instead of from 1 (optimal results should be exactly the same)
504. Stochastic disturbances update 2:
	- Fix No_Merge: eq 5a to 5j
	- Fix Merge: eq 5a to 5d
	- Add 7a (7 is now 7b)
	- Add 8a (8 is now 8b)
	- output_02 now writes the total_loss_rate_mean (sum all the loss means) and var_rd_condition_id (to look for each SR information) null value is write out as -9999
	- use map var_name to var_value for F~ instead of map var_index to var_value (bug still exists but the result looks much better)
	- fix the wrong var_name for xEA_E and xEA_R in eq (7a). s5RR should be used. Bug seems to be fixed with no sign of area growing but still not 100% matching results.
	- (commit to stochastic_disturbances_07 and switch to stochastic_disturbances_08)
	- instead of using total_loss_rate_mean in output_02, var_rd_condition_id would be used. This fix all the issues and make the results almost 100% matched.
	- (commit to stochastic_disturbances_08, push to Bitbucket, and switch to stochastic_disturbances_09)
505. Adjust column width and add tooltip for the table when solving to improve its UI
506. Add import database button to Database Management task bar
507. make all buttons in Projects and Databases task bars to be unfocusable to avoid ugly border occasinally showing up when doing tasks.
508. Add compact button to Project task bar. This would help displaying all or fewer outputs (specific outputs from iterations would be hidden)
509. All compact view buttons is now having the color changing effect (EA Management, SR Disturbances, Management Cost, Area Merging)
510. Implement random drawn for loss rate only under the assumption of normal distribution (conversion rate is still deterministic, not stochastic). Drawing is implemented in order from the first (SR_01) to the last (SR_...) disturbances (commit to stochastic_disturbances_09, push to Bitbucket, and switch to stochastic_disturbances_10)
511. Fix bug 113 covertype conversion & rotation age information is unexpectedly rewritten
512. Hide conversion rate std table (in ScrollPane_SubTables_SR_Disturbances) since we do not allow random drawn for conversion rate
513. Add full quick edit functionality for LR mean, LR std, CR mean
514. Add filter for LR mean and LR std. Note that the synchronize might be incorrect due to different views from the 2 tables under compact view mode
515. Revise all tooltip and warning icons for tables 6a, 6b, 6c (LR mean, LR std, CR mean). Specially, Warning icon on tale 6c will show up only when at least 1 SR has lat least 1 loss rate mean or loss rate std more than zero
516. Add split pane to allow adjustable size of the tables in SR Disturbances screen and Management Cost screen
517. The random drawing results for stochastic losses are proportionally adjusted (commit to stochastic_disturbances_10, push to Bitbucket, and switch to stochastic_disturbances_11)
518: Allow 2 options for solving any single iteration: 1) use the mean value of loss rate only or 2) use the random drawn loss rate
	- Solve_Iterations class: add map_var_index_to_user_chosen_loss_rate with user_chosen_loss_rate of 0 or 1 for deterministic or stochastic SR loss within a single iteration
	- Solve_Iterations class: use the map_var_index_to_user_chosen_loss_rate by modifying at cost alculation, 6a, 6b, 6c, 6d, 6e, 6f, 7b, 9, printing output_02 and output_05
	- Add LRWI column in the solving table to allow the aboe 2 options (commit to stochastic_disturbances_11 and switch to stochastic_disturbances_12)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
519. Dynamically load the Temporary folder by adding -Djava.library.path into the OptionPane_Startup class. At the same time, the addLibrary in  Solve_Iterations class is removed due to deprecated. These help clear the bugs 109 and 115 listed in BitBucket. Note that from now:
	- cplex.jar could be in the same directory as other jar files
	- prismplex_lib folder could now be removed from the package
	- all .dll files of cplex and lpsolve could be in Temporary folder of the Prism jar package (or C:\Users\Dung Nguyen\Desktop\Temporary if running Prism using Eclipse IDE) 
520. Fix exporting outputs for LPSOLVE
521. Add 2 more information into output_01_general_output:
	- Rolling horizon - iterating method
	- Rolling horizon - loss rate within iteration
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha2.0.04.jar, Prism-Formulation-10.docx, Rolling-horizon-formulation-07.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
522. SQL Mode update
	- output_05 is now have 2 more information added: iteration, loss_rate_total
	- output_05 is now having only the summarize_output_05_management_details exported into database, data from specific iterations are excluded
	- SQL Mode is now showing when the file summarize_output_05_management_details.txt is selected
	- More than 30 system queries revised for the SQL Mode when summarize_output_05_management_details is selected
523. Fix bug 116 (incorrect positive loss rate for EA variable when the activity is clear cut) by adding code to the class Information_Disturbance and modifying code in the class Solve_Iterations to capture correct rd_condition_id for the EA variables at clear-cutting period
All changes in this block are associated with PrismAlpha2.0.05.jar, Prism-Formulation-10.docx, Rolling-horizon-formulation-07.docx
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
524. Speed up the process of reading file into JTable by modifying in the Panel_Project and Panel_Edit_Details (Reload_Table_Info)
525. Activate NOSQL MODE to help study optimal solutions from all the solved iterations
526. In NO SQL MODE for summarize_output_05, all value_iteration_  would be reset to null when the query_multiplier is edited manually or by the Quick Edit
527. Improve speed of calculating NOSQL queries by remove unnecessary arrays and loops, also improve UI of the NOSQL table
528. Boost reading speed when solving models by using hashmaps for strata and strata_5layers across all the places in Solve_Iterations class
529. Simplify the SQL and NOSQL Modes:
	- show maximum of 999 records if summarize_output_05 has more records,
	- summarize_output_05 is processed faster: processed in the NOSQL Mode, only necessary data would be read and read directly to String to avoid data conversion
530. Boost data reading speed significantly in NOSQL Mode by performing the whole reading process by executor.submit (before the btn_GetResult). By somehow the database is retrieved much more faster (I guess because the database is remembered correctly). The other good thing is even when we add rows and click on the calculator button, the calculation would only start after data reading have been completed.
531. All summarize outputs will be deleted when the model is started solving on button click. 
532. When the user-defined method is continue and the user-defined max iteration is less than the last solved iteration, data would be trim to recreate the summarize files, and data pre-processing would not be implemented
533. Add zoom functionality to improve chart view for 3 summary outputs: 04 management overview, 06 basic constraints, 07 flow constraints
